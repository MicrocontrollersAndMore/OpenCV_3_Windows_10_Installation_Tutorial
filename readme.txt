Welcome to the OpenCV 3 Windows 10 Installation Tutorial !!

If you are unsure where to start I would recommend starting at the beginning of Installation Cheat Sheet 1, then working your way through each of the 4 Cheat Sheets.  It would be highly recommended to view the YouTube videos accompanying each Cheat Sheet (link available at the top of each Cheat Sheet).

All installation/configuration procedures and programs have been thoroughly tested on Windows 10.  To my knowledge they should all work on Windows 7/8/8.1 with only minor differences in menu choices, but this has not been tested by me personally so I cannot vouch for 7/8/8.1.  Testing was performed on a Dell desktop and HP ProBook, both Windows 10 64-bit computers.

Parts 1 - 4 cover the following:

1) Visual Studio 2015 and precompiled binaries
2) Python 2
3) Emgu CV (Visual Basic.NET and C#)
4) OpenCV compile from source, configuration with Visual Studio 2015 and Qt, and a Qt GUI program
